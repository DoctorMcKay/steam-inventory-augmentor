# Steam Inventory Augmentor

Adds a "Duplicate" tag to inventory filters to show only items you have more than one of (does not show the first copy of the item).  
Also makes the "Turn Into Gems" button work instantly and without reloading the inventory.

Note: The "Duplicate" tag does not appear in the tags list when viewing an item (yet).

Only tested under Tampermonkey.
